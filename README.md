Arvin is my English name. I am an incompetent developer finally building the personal site with Vue.js 3 and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). It is designed with the following primary principles.

- Responsive design.
- Unified styles.
- Dark mode support.
- I18n (Internationalisation): English / 简体中文.
- Accessibility: reduced motion when required.

The structure of the site is as follows. Please note that the code is licensed under [the GPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE).

## ATTENTION

1. By 5 September 2021, everything looks good with Visual Studio Code (Version: 1.60.0) + Node.js 16.4.2 + Vue CLI 5.0.0-beta.3. Additionaly, I would like to thankfully acknowledge Tailwind for [its rich and extensible CSS framework and resources](https://tailwindcss.com/resources), which save much development time.
2. The primary dependencies of the project are listed in the following table.
