**English** | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](./README-zhCN.md)

When I was a green high school student, I learned to solve a limited scope of problems using C++. It was the first time I could move a tiny step to the programming language, no doubt. Then, as a 1st-year undergraduate, I started to study Software Development. I imagined becoming a World No.1 full-stack developer ~~(but obviously, I just loafed around)~~. When I knew about HTML ~~(How to Meet Ladies)~~ and Bootstrap, I also wished to design and implement modern-designed good-looking UI kits that would be pretty popular. Today, I am an incompetent developer building the personal site with Vue.js 3 and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). So this is Arvin.ðŸ˜‰

The site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home). It is designed with the following primary principles.

- Responsive design.
- Unified styles.
- Dark mode support.
- I18n (Internationalisation): English / ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡.
- Accessibility: reduced motion when required.

The structure of the site is as follows. Please note that the code is licensed under [the GPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE).

## ATTENTION

1. By 27 August 2021, everything looks good with Visual Studio Code (Version: 1.59.1) + Node.js 16.4.2 + Vue CLI 5.0.0-beta.3. Additionaly, I would like to thankfully acknowledge Tailwind for [its rich and extensible CSS framework and resources](https://tailwindcss.com/resources), which save much development time.
2. The primary dependencies of the project are listed in the following table.

    | Name | Version |
